  title     = {Apache Flink{\texttrademark}: Stream and Batch Processing in a Single Engine},
  abstract  = {Apache Flink is an open-source system for processing streaming and batch data. Flink is built on the philosophy that many classes of data processing applications, including real-time analytics, continuous data pipelines, historic data processing (batch), and iterative algorithms (machine learning, graph analysis) can be expressed and executed as pipelined fault-tolerant dataflows. In this paper, we present Flink{\textquoteright}s architecture and expand on how a (seemingly diverse) set of use cases can be unified under asingle execution model.},
