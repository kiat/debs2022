\begin{abstract}
  High-performance real-time monitoring of the stock market data stream is one of the challenging use cases of
  stream processing systems. By monitoring real-time stock price patterns via high-throughput event stream processing,
  real-time stock trading advice can be generated. In this paper, we describe our implementation of a system for the DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge to extract
  breakout patterns from real-time stock market data. Breakout patterns, based on exponential moving averages
  crossover events, indicate potential bullish or bearish trends, giving investors insight and the opportunity to buy or sell
  at optimal times. We report details of our high-performance implementation to extract such patterns from a real-time stream to generate stock
  trading advice event notification outputs. Furthermore, we report the architectural design of our system for parallel processing of data stream, which we
  implemented from scratch using Python and Java programming languages.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclustion}
In this paper, we described our different architectures for a stock market data stream processing to implement the DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge.
Our implementation and evaluation are limited due to the time constraints we had for this work.
One potential improvement would be to implement it using a system programming language.
Also, it would be interesting to evaluate how a from-scratch-implemented system would perform in this case
compared to some large-scale cluster-based stream processing systems like Apache Storm or Flink.

\section{Acknowledgment}
We would like to thank the organizers of the DEBS 2022 Grand Challenge for developing this implementation challenge.
