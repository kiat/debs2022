\begin{abstract}
High-performance monitoring of the stock market data stream is one of the challenging use cases of 
the data stream processing systems. Different continuous queries can be defined by market brokers to provide 
buy and sell advice. 
In this paper, we describe our implementation of a system for the DEBS2022 Grand Challenge to extract 
breakout patterns from real-time stock market data to provide buy and sell notifications. Breakout patterns 
are specified based on long intervals of 50 days and 100 days known as the golden cross to indicate a golden 
opportunity for long-term investments. We report details of our high-performance implementation to extract such 
patterns in real-time be able to generate real-time buy and sell notifications.
