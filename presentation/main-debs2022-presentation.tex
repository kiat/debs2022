\begin{itemize}
    \item Two queries on Stock Market Stream Data`'
    \item The first query is defined to compute the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) with two different smoothing factors of 38 and 100.
    \item The sequent query is a breakout pattern based on the first query. 
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

        \item The coefficient $\alpha$ represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1.
        \item $\alpha = \frac{2}{1+j}$ where $j$ is a smoothing factor with $j \in \{38, 100 \}$.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{ Use one of the OSS or implement from scratch?}


    Should we use one of the Open Source Stream processing systems like: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \blueb{Apache Spark - Streaming}
    \item \blueb{Apache Flink - Streaming}
    \item \blueb{Apache Storm}
    \item \blueb{Apache Kafka for streaming pipelines} 
    \item \blueb{Esper Stream processing}
    \item  ... 
\end{itemize}

    We decided to implement the DEBS Grand Challenge from scratch. 
    
    \redb{Why?}
